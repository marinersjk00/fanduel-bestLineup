## Project Description


On websites like FanDuel.com and DraftKings.com, one can play "daily fantasy sports" which differ from typical fantasy sports in that your team is only your team for one day. In regular fantasy basketball, when you draft your team at the start of the year, you're stuck with pretty much the same team throughout the year whether they're good, bad, healthy, or unhealthy. In daily fantasy basketball, if one of your players gets a season-ending injury, you will be down for a night but can just simply choose to avoid picking that player the next time you play.

The goal of daily fantasy is to draft the best possible lineup for that day's slate of games. The most surefire way to do this, although there is no surefire way since we cannot predict the future, would be to draft all the top players. However, this is not possible because there is an implemented salary cap. The star players who typically have great games every night are far more expensive than the secondary players who average much lower statistics. But, on any given night, any player can have a great game regardless of how consistently good they've been in the past. Thus, the goal of daily fantasy is to work within the limitations of the salary cap to find the best possible lineup for that day. This will almost always be a mix of a couple big stars and more secondary players that one might personally think will do well that night.

Now, again, we cannot accurately predict the future. That said, we can use past data to help us in our attempts to accurately predict the future. The goal of our program is to be able to return the best possible lineup from a given past day knowing all the stats of all the possible players now exist and are unchangeable. The user should be able to enter a day in the past that basketball games occurred, and from that the program should return at least the best possible lineup, if not the top 2 or 3 best possible lineups. The user can then use this information to try and find more under the radar players that seem to consistently do well when he/she is creating his future lineups. We plan to do as much as possible in C++, although SQL and possibly JDBC may be necessary to organize data.

 > ## Phase II
 > In addition to completing the "Class Diagram" section below, you will need to:
 > * Create an "Epic" (note) for each feature and each design pattern and assign them to the appropriate team member. Place these in the `Backlog` column
 > * Complete your first *sprint planning* meeting to plan out the next 7 days of work.
 >   * Create smaller actionable development tasks as issues and assign them to team members. Place these in the `TODO` column.
 >   * These cards should represent roughly 7 days worth of development time for your team, taking you until your first meeting with the TA
 > * Schedule two check-ins using Calendly. You need to pick both time slots during your lab on week 8. Your entire team must be present for both check-ins.
 >   * The first check-in needs to be scheduled with your lab TA. During that meeting, you will discuss your project design/class diagram from phase II.
 >   * The second check-in should be scheduled with a reader. During that meeting you will discuss:
 >     * The tasks you are planning for the first sprint
 >     * How work will be divided between the team members

## Class Diagram
 > Include a **class diagram(s)** for your project and a **description** of the diagram(s). Your class diagram(s) should include all the main classes you plan for the project. This should be in sufficient detail that another group could pick up the project this point and successfully complete it. Use proper UML notation (as discussed in the course slides).
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with a reader (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 but NOT during lab time.
 > * Before the meeting you should perform a sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also update this README file by adding the following:
 >   * What design pattern(s) did you use? For each pattern you must explain in 4-5 sentences:
 >     * Why did you pick this pattern? And what feature did you implement with it?
 >     * How did the design pattern help you write better code?
 >   * An updated class diagram that reflects the design pattern(s) you used. You may combine multiple design patterns into one diagram if you'd like, but it needs to be clear which portion of the diagram represents which design pattern (either in the diagram or in the description).
 >   * Make sure your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
> 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the TA/reader during lab time. The TA/reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
